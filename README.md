# Calm

Calm is a meta development tool that helps you manage your development
environment in a way that you can automate as much as possible without
having to manually configure countless tools.  It automatically manages
linters, formatters and other tools so you don't have to.

Currently only supports linters.  For a default project see `demo`

## Commands

``calm update``
  Updates the toolchain and links things.

``calm lint``
  Runs the configured linters.
